     (Look out for yourself)<br>
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground<br>
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told<br>
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned<br>
<br>
Tell you: You're the greatest<br>
But once you turn, they hate us<br>
<br>
Oh, the misery<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
(Look out for yourself)<br>
My enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
(Look out for yourself)<br>
But I'm ready<br>
<br>
Your words up on the wall as you'rе praying for my fall<br>
And the laughter in thе halls<br>
And the names that I've been called<br>
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time<br>
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br>
<br>
Tell you: You're the greatest<br>
But once you turn, they hate us<br>
<br>
Oh, the misery<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
(Look out for yourself)<br>
My enemy-y-y-y-y (yeah)<br>
(Look out for yourself)<br>
<br>
Uh, look, okay<br>
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me<br>
I'm praying that somebody hope for me<br>
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be<br>
P-p-posted, being a wreck of emotions<br>
Ready to go whenever just let me know<br>
The road is long so put the pedal into the floor<br>
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
I'ma tell 'em: Hasta luego<br>
They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
I've been outta shape, thinking out the box I'm an astronaut<br>
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe<br>
And it matters more because I had it not<br>
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition<br>
Kinda shockin' they wanted a static with precision I'm automatic quaterback<br>
I ain't talking sacking, pack it, pack it up, I don't panic<br>
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?<br>
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat<br>
<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Oh, the misery<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
<br>
Pray it away, I swear<br>
I'll never be a saint, no way<br>
My enemy<br>
Pray it away, I swear<br>
I'll never be a saint<br>
(Look out for yourself)<br>
